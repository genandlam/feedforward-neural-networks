# Overview

This repository was created for a coursework project for Neural Networks (CZ4042) at NTU, Singapore. Our tasks were to study deep neural networks for classification and regression.

Check out Project_Report.pdf for more information and details about our apporach, as well as our results and some pretty graphs.

## PART A â€“ CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM

Most of the experiments are conducted using a feedforward neural network with hidden perceptron layer(s) and a output softmax layer, with L2 regularisation implemented. For weight training, minibatch gradient descent is used as per the question requirement.

Sequential mini batch training is used, where if there is a final small batch, we sample the 32 samples of the dataset again. Thus, one epoch may sample more than 4435 rows of data.

## PART B : REGRESSION PROBLEM

Given the California Housing Price Dataset which contains attributes of housing complexes in California such as location, size of house, etc, together with their corresponding prices. We are supposed to build a model that estimate the pricing given its attributes.
